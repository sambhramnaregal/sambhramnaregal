## Hi there,👋
I am Sambhram S Naregal a Computer Science Engineering (Data Science) student with a strong interest in AI and Machine Learning. I enjoy building systems where data, models, and software come together to solve practical problems — from intelligent web applications to applied ML and deep learning projects.

My work mostly revolves around machine learning pipelines, data analysis, and model-driven applications. I have hands-on experience building Streamlit apps, training and evaluating ML/DL models, working with APIs and real-world datasets, and deploying prototypes that are both functional and interpretable. I place a strong emphasis on understanding the data and the model behavior, not just achieving accuracy.

Currently, I’m exploring deep learning and applied AI, including projects related to computer vision, healthcare AI (fetal anomaly detection), and AI-powered decision systems. I’m also interested in LLM-based applications, such as retrieval-augmented systems, and how AI can be responsibly used in real-world domains.

🚀 I’m open to opportunities in AI/ML, Data Science, and Applied AI roles (internships, research roles, and entry-level positions), where I can learn from experienced teams, contribute meaningfully, and grow as an engineer.
